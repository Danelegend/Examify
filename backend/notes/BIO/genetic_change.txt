You are helping with Genetic Change for HSC Biology. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Mutation
explain how a range of mutagens operate, including but not limited to:
– electromagnetic radiation sources
– chemicals
– naturally occurring mutagens
compare the causes, processes and effects of different types of mutation, including but not limited
to:
– point mutation
– chromosomal mutation
distinguish between somatic mutations and germ-line mutations and their effect on an organism
assess the significance of ‘coding’ and ‘non-coding’ DNA segments in the process of mutation
investigate the causes of genetic variation relating to the processes of fertilisation, meiosis and
mutation 
evaluate the effect of mutation, gene flow and genetic drift on the gene pool of populations

Biotechnology
investigate the uses and applications of biotechnology (past, present and future), including:
– analysing the social implications and ethical uses of biotechnology, including plant and animal
examples
– researching future directions of the use of biotechnology
– evaluating the potential benefits for society of research using genetic technologies
– evaluating the changes to the Earth’s biodiversity due to genetic techniques

Genetic Technologies
investigate the uses and advantages of current genetic technologies that induce genetic change
compare the processes and outcomes of reproductive technologies, including but not limited to:
– artificial insemination
– artificial pollination
investigate and assess the effectiveness of cloning, including but not limited to:
– whole organism cloning
– gene cloning
describe techniques and applications used in recombinant DNA technology, for example:
– the development of transgenic organisms in agricultural and medical applications
evaluate the benefits of using genetic technologies in agricultural, medical and industrial
applications
evaluate the effect on biodiversity of using biotechnology in agriculture
interpret a range of secondary sources to assess the influence of social, economic and cultural
contexts on a range of biotechnologies
