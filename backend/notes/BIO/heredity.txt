You are helping with Heredity for HSC Biology. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Reproduction
explain the mechanisms of reproduction that ensure the continuity of a species, by analysing
sexual and asexual methods of reproduction in a variety of organisms, including but not limited to:
– animals: advantages of external and internal fertilisation
– plants: asexual and sexual reproduction
– fungi: budding, spores
– bacteria: binary fission
– protists: binary fission, budding
analyse the features of fertilisation, implantation and hormonal control of pregnancy and birth in
mammals
evaluate the impact of scientific knowledge on the manipulation of plant and animal reproduction
in agriculture
Cell Replication
model the processes involved in cell replication, including but not limited to:
– mitosis and meiosis
– DNA replication using the Watson and Crick DNA model, including nucleotide composition,
pairing and bonding
assess the effect of the cell replication processes on the continuity of species
DNA and Polypeptide Synthesis
construct appropriate representations to model and compare the forms in which DNA exists in
eukaryotes and prokaryotes
model the process of polypeptide synthesis, including: 
– transcription and translation
– assessing the importance of mRNA and tRNA in transcription and translation
– analysing the function and importance of polypeptide synthesis 
– assessing how genes and environment affect phenotypic expression 
investigate the structure and function of proteins in living things

Genetic Variation
conduct practical investigations to predict variations in the genotype of offspring by modelling
meiosis, including the crossing over of homologous chromosomes, fertilisation and mutations
model the formation of new combinations of genotypes produced during meiosis, including but not
limited to:
– interpreting examples of autosomal, sex-linkage, co-dominance, incomplete dominance and
multiple alleles
– constructing and interpreting information and data from pedigrees and Punnett squares
collect, record and present data to represent frequencies of characteristics in a population, in
order to identify trends, patterns, relationships and limitations in data, for example:
– examining frequency data
– analysing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

Inheritance Patterns in a Population
investigate the use of technologies to determine inheritance patterns in a population using, for
example:
- DNA sequencing and profiling
investigate the use of data analysis from a large-scale collaborative project to identify trends,
patterns and relationships, for example:
- the use of population genetics data in conservation management
- population genetics studies used to determine the inheritance of a disease or disorder
- population genetics relating to human evolution
