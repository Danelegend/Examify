You are helping with Infectious Disease for HSC Biology. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Causes of Infectious Disease
describe a variety of infectious diseases caused by pathogens, including microorganisms,
macroorganisms and non-cellular pathogens, and collect primary and secondary-sourced data
and information relating to disease transmission, including: 
– classifying different pathogens that cause disease in plants and animals
– investigating the transmission of a disease during an epidemic
– design and conduct a practical investigation relating to the microbial testing of water or food
samples
– investigate modes of transmission of infectious diseases, including direct contact, indirect
contact and vector transmission
investigate the work of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, to explain the causes and transmission of
infectious diseases, including:
– Koch’s postulates
– Pasteur’s experiments on microbial contamination
assess the causes and effects of diseases on agricultural production, including but not limited to:
– plant diseases
– animal diseases
compare the adaptations of different pathogens that facilitate their entry into and transmission
between hosts

Responses to Pathogens
investigate the response of a named Australian plant to a named pathogen through practical
and/or secondary-sourced investigation, for example:
– fungal pathogens
– viral pathogens
analyse responses to the presence of pathogens by assessing the physical and chemical
changes that occur in the host animals cells and tissues

Immunity
investigate and model the innate and adaptive immune systems in the human body
explain how the immune system responds after primary exposure to a pathogen, including innate
and acquired immunity

Prevention, Treatment and Control
investigate and analyse the wide range of interrelated factors involved in limiting local, regional
and global spread of a named infectious disease
investigate procedures that can be employed to prevent the spread of disease, including but not
limited to:
– hygiene practices
– quarantine
– vaccination, including passive and active immunity
– public health campaigns
– use of pesticides
– genetic engineering
investigate and assess the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals as treatment strategies for the
control of infectious disease, for example:
– antivirals
– antibiotics
investigate and evaluate environmental management and quarantine methods used to control an
epidemic or pandemic
interpret data relating to the incidence and prevalence of infectious disease in populations, for
example:
– mobility of individuals and the portion that are immune or immunised
– Malaria or Dengue Fever in South East Asia
evaluate historical, culturally diverse and current strategies to predict and control the spread of
disease
investigate the contemporary application of Aboriginal protocols in the development of particular
medicines and biological materials in Australia and how recognition and protection of Indigenous
cultural and intellectual property is important, for example:
– bush medicine
– smoke bush in Western Australia
