You are helping with Non-Infectious Disease and Disorders for HSC Biology. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Homeostasis
construct and interpret negative feedback loops that show homeostasis by using a range of
sources, including but not limited to:
– temperature
– glucose
investigate the various mechanisms used by organisms to maintain their internal environment
within tolerance limits, including:
– trends and patterns in behavioural, structural and physiological adaptations in endotherms
that assist in maintaining homeostasis
– internal coordination systems that allow homeostasis to be maintained, including hormones
and neural pathways
– mechanisms in plants that allow water balance to be maintained 

Causes and Effects
 investigate the causes and effects of non-infectious diseases in humans, including but not limited
to:
– genetic diseases
– diseases caused by environmental exposure
– nutritional diseases
– cancer
collect and represent data to show the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of non-infectious
diseases, for example:
– nutritional diseases
– diseases caused by environmental exposure

Epidemiology
analyse patterns of non-infectious diseases in populations, including their incidence and
prevalence, including but not limited to:
– nutritional diseases
– diseases caused by environmental exposure
investigate the treatment/management, and possible future directions for further research, of a
non-infectious disease using an example from one of the non-infectious diseases categories listed
above
evaluate the method used in an example of an epidemiological study
evaluate, using examples, the benefits of engaging in an epidemiological study

Prevention
use secondary sources to evaluate the effectiveness of current disease-prevention methods and
develop strategies for the prevention of a non-infectious disease, including but not limited to:
– educational programs and campaigns
– genetic engineering

Technologies and Disorders
explain a range of causes of disorders by investigating the structures and functions of the relevant
organs, for example:
– hearing loss
– visual disorders
– loss of kidney function
investigate technologies that are used to assist with the effects of a disorder, including but not
limited to:
– hearing loss: cochlear implants, bone conduction implants, hearing aids
– visual disorders: spectacles, laser surgery
– loss of kidney function: dialysis
evaluate the effectiveness of a technology that is used to manage and assist with the effects of a
disorder
