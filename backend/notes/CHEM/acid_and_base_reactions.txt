You are helping with Acid and Base Reactions for HSC Chemistry. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Properties of Acids and Bases
investigate the correct IUPAC nomenclature and properties of common inorganic acids and bases
predict the products of acid reactions and write balanced equations to represent: acids and bases, acids and carbonates, acids and metals
investigate applications of neutralisation reactions in everyday life and industrial processes
conduct a practical investigation to measure the enthalpy of neutralisation
explore the changes in definitions and models of an acid and a base over time to explain the limitations of each model, including but not limited to: Arrhenius’ theory, Brønsted–Lowry theory
Using Bronsted Lowry Theory 
conduct a practical investigation to measure the pH of a range of acids and bases
conduct an investigation to demonstrate the use of pH to indicate the differences between the strength of acids and bases 
write ionic equations to represent the dissociation of acids and bases in water, conjugate acid/base pairs in solution and amphiprotic nature of some salts, for example: sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate
construct models and/or animations to communicate the differences between strong, weak, concentrated and dilute acids and bases
Quantative Analysis
conduct practical investigations to analyse the concentration of an unknown acid or base by titration
investigate titration curves and conductivity graphs to analyse data to indicate characteristic reaction profiles, for example: strong acid/strong base, strong acid/weak base, weak acid/strong base
model neutralisation of strong and weak acids and bases using a variety of media  
calculate and apply the dissociation constant (Ka) and pKa (pKa = -log10 (Ka)) to determine the difference between strong and weak acids
explore acid/base analysis techniques that are applied: in industries, by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples , using digital probes and instruments
conduct a chemical analysis of a common household substance for its acidity or basicity, for example: soft drink, wine, juice, medicine
conduct a practical investigation to prepare a buffer and demonstrate its properties
describe the importance of buffers in natural systems
