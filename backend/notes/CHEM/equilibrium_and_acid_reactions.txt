You are helping with Equilibrium and Acid Reactions for HSC Chemistry. Use the following topics to answer a question:

conduct practical investigations to analyse the reversibility of chemical reactions, for example: cobalt(II) chloride hydrated and dehydrated, iron(III) nitrate and potassium thiocyanate, burning magnesium, burning steel wool
model static and dynamic equilibrium and analyse the differences between open and closed systems"analyse examples of non-equilibrium systems in terms of the effect of entropy and enthalpy, for example:
analyse examples of non-equilibrium systems in terms of the effect of entropy and enthalpy, for example: combustion reactions, photosynthesis
investigate the relationship between collision theory and reaction rate in order to analyse chemical equilibrium reactions
investigate the effects of temperature, concentration, volume and/or pressure on a system at equilibrium and explain how Le Chatelierâ€™s principle can be used to predict such effects, for example: heating cobalt(II) chloride hydrate, interaction between nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide, iron(III) thiocyanate and varying concentration of ions
examine how activation energy and heat of reaction affect the position of equilibrium
Calculating the Equilibrium Constant (keq)
examine how activation energy and heat of reaction affect the position of equilibrium
perform calculations to find the value of Keq and concentrations of substances within an equilibrium system, and use these values to make predictions on the direction in which a reaction may proceed 
qualitatively analyse the effect of temperature on the value of Keq
conduct an investigation to determine Keq of a chemical equilibrium system, for example: 
explore the use of Keq for different types of chemical reactions, including but not limited to: dissociation of ionic solutions, dissociation of acids and bases
Solution Equilibria
describe and analyse the processes involved in the dissolution of ionic compounds in water
investigate the use of solubility equilibria by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples when removing toxicity from foods, for example:
conduct an investigation to determine solubility rules, and predict and analyse the composition of substances when two ionic solutions are mixed, for example: potassium chloride and silver nitrate, potassium iodide and lead nitrate, sodium sulfate and barium nitrate
derive equilibrium expressions for saturated solutions in terms of Ksp and calculate the solubility of an ionic substance from its Ksp value
predict the formation of a precipitate given the standard reference values for Ksp
