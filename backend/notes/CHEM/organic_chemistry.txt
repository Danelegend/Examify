You are helping with Organic Chemistry for HSC Chemistry. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Nomenclature
investigate the nomenclature of organic chemicals, up to C8, using IUPAC conventions, including simple methyl and ethyl branched chains, including: alkanes, alkenes, alcohols (primary, secondary and tertiary), aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids, amines and amides, halogenated organic compounds
explore and distinguish the different types of structural isomers, including saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, including: chain isomers, position isomers, functional group isomers
Hydrocarbons
construct models, identify the functional group, and write structural and molecular formulae for homologous series of organic chemical compounds, up to C8: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes
conduct an investigation to compare the properties of organic chemical compounds within a homologous series, and explain these differences in terms of bonding 
analyse the shape of molecules formed between carbon atoms when a single, double or triple bond is formed between them
explain the properties within and between the homologous series of alkanes with reference to the intermolecular and intramolecular bonding present
describe the procedures required to safely handle and dispose of organic substances
examine the environmental, economic and sociocultural implications of obtaining and using hydrocarbons from the Earth
Products of Reactions Involving Hydrocarbons
investigate, write equations and construct models to represent the reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons when added to a range of chemicals, including but not limited to: hydrogen (H2), halogens (X2), hydrogen halides (HX), water (H2O)
investigate, write equations and construct models to represent the reactions of saturated hydrocarbons when substituted with halogens
Alcohols 
investigate the structural formulae, properties and functional group including: primary, secondary, tertiary alcohols
explain the properties within and between the homologous series of alcohols with reference to the intermolecular and intramolecular bonding present  
write equations, state conditions and predict products to represent the reactions of alcohols, including but not limited to: combustion, dehydration, substitution with HX, oxidation
investigate the production of alcohols, including: substitution reactions of halogenated organic compounds, fermentation
investigate the products of the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols
compare and contrast fuels from organic sources to biofuels, including ethanol
Reactions of Organic Acids and Bases
investigate the structural formulae, properties and functional group including: primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, amines and amide, carboxylic acids
explain the properties within and between the homologous series of carboxylic acids amines and amides with reference to the intermolecular and intramolecular bonding present
investigate the production, in a school laboratory, of simple esters
investigate the differences between an organic acid and organic base
investigate the structure and action of soaps and detergents
draft and construct flow charts to show reaction pathways for chemical synthesis, including those that involve more than one step 
Polymers
model and compare the structure, properties and uses of addition polymers of ethylene and related monomers, for example: polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
model and compare the structure, properties and uses of condensation polymers, for example: nylon, polyesters
