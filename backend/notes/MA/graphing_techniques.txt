Transformation of graphs using y = f(x + b) and y = f(x) + c
Transformation of graphs using y = kf(x) and y = kf(x + b)
Transformation of graphs using y = f(ax) and y = f(a(x + b))
Graphing rational algebraic functions
Applications involving graphing functions
Graphical solution of equations
Regions and inequalities
Simultaneous linear inequalities
