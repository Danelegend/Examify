You are helping with Advanced Mechanics for HSC Physics. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Projectile Motion
analyse the motion of projectiles by resolving the motion into horizontal and vertical components,
making the following assumptions:
– a constant vertical acceleration due to gravity
– zero air resistance
apply the modelling of projectile motion to quantitatively derive the relationships between the
following variables:
– initial velocity
– launch angle
– maximum height
– time of flight
– final velocity
– launch height
– horizontal range of the projectile
conduct a practical investigation to collect primary data in order to validate the relationships
derived above.
solve problems, create models and make quantitative predictions by applying the equations of
motion relationships for uniformly accelerated and constant rectilinear motion
Circular Motion 
conduct investigations to explain and evaluate, for objects executing uniform circular motion, the
relationships that exist between:
– centripetal force
– mass
– speed
– radius
● analyse the forces acting on an object executing uniform circular motion in a variety of situations,
for example:
– cars moving around horizontal circular bends
– a mass on a string
– objects on banked tracks
solve problems, model and make quantitative predictions about objects executing uniform circular
motion in a variety of situations, using the following relationships:
 - $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$
 - $v = \frac{2 * \pi * r}{T}$
 - $F_c = \frac{m * v^2}{r}$
 - $\omega = \frac{\delta \theta}{t}$
investigate the relationship between the total energy and work done on an object executing
uniform circular motion
investigate the relationship between the rotation of mechanical systems and the applied torque
 - $torque = r * F * \sin{\theta}$
Motion in Gravitational Fields
apply qualitatively and quantitatively Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to:
determine the force of gravity between two objects 
 - $F = \frac{G * M * m}{r^2}$
investigate the factors that affect the gravitational field strength 
 - $g = \frac{G * M}{r^2}$
predict the gravitational field strength at any point in a gravitational field, including at the
surface of a planet
investigate the orbital motion of planets and artificial satellites when applying the relationships
between the following quantities:
– gravitational force
– centripetal force
– centripetal acceleration
– mass
– orbital radius
– orbital velocity
– orbital period
predict quantitatively the orbital properties of planets and satellites in a variety of situations,
including near the Earth and geostationary orbits, and relate these to their uses
investigate the relationship of Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion to the forces acting on, and the
total energy of, planets in circular and non-circular orbits using:
 - $v = \frac{2 * \pi * r}{T}$
 - $\frac{r^3}{T^2} = \frac{G * M}{4 * \pi^2}$
derive quantitatively and apply the concepts of gravitational force and gravitational potential
energy in radial gravitational fields to a variety of situations, including but not limited to: 
 - the concept of escape velocity $v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2 * G * M}{r}}$
 - total potential energy of a planet or satellite in its orbit $U = -\frac{G * M * m}{r}$
 - total energy of a planet or satellite in its orbit $U + K = -\frac{G * M * m}{2 * r}$
 - energy changes that occur when satellites move between orbits 
 - Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
