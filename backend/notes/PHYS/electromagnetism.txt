Charged Particles, Conductors and Electric and Magnetic Fields
investigate and quantitatively derive and analyse the interaction between charged particles and
uniform electric fields, including:
 - electric field between parallel charged plates $E = \frac{V}{d}$
 - acceleration of charged particles by the electric field $F_{net} = ma, F = qE$
 - work done on the charge $W = qV, W = qEd, K = 1/2 * m * v^^2$
model qualitatively and quantitatively the trajectories of charged particles in electric fields and
compare them with the trajectories of projectiles in a gravitational field
analyse the interaction between charged particles and uniform magnetic fields, including:
 - acceleration, perpendicular to the field, of charged particles
 - the force on the charge $F = qvB = qvB * \sin{\theta}$
compare the interaction of charged particles moving in magnetic fields to:
 - the interaction of charged particles with electric fields
 - other examples of uniform circular motion
The Motor Effect
investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the interaction between a current-carrying conductor and a uniform magnetic field $F = l*I*B = l*I*B*\sin{\theta}$ to establish
 - conditions under which the maximum force is produced
 – the relationship between the directions of the force, magnetic field strength and current
 – conditions under which no force is produced on the conductor
conduct a quantitative investigation to demonstrate the interaction between two parallel currentcarrying wires
analyse the interaction between two parallel current-carrying wires $F / l = \frac{\mu_0}{2 * \pi} * \frac{I_1 * I_2}{r}$ and determine the
relationship between the International System of Units (SI) definition of an ampere and Newton’s
Third Law of Motion
Electromagnetic Induction
describe how magnetic flux can change, with reference to the relationship $\phi = B * A * \cos{\theta}$
analyse qualitatively and quantitatively, with reference to energy transfers and transformations,
examples of Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law $\epsilon = -N \frac{\delta \phi}{\delta t}$, including but not limited to: 
– the generation of an electromotive force (emf) and evidence for Lenz’s Law produced by the
relative movement between a magnet, straight conductors, metal plates and solenoids
– the generation of an emf produced by the relative movement or changes in current in one
solenoid in the vicinity of another solenoid
analyse quantitatively the operation of ideal transformers through the application of: 
 - $\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$
 - $V_pI_p = V_sI_s$
 evaluate qualitatively the limitations of the ideal transformer model and the strategies used to
improve transformer efficiency, including but not limited to:
– incomplete flux linkage
– resistive heat production and eddy currents
analyse applications of step-up and step-down transformers, including but not limited to:
– the distribution of energy using high-voltage transmission lines
Applications of the Motor Effect
investigate the operation of a simple DC motor to analyse:
– the functions of its components
– production of a torque $\tau = n * I * A * B * \sin{\theta}$
- effects of back emf
analyse the operation of simple DC and AC generators and AC induction motors
relate Lenz’s Law to the law of conservation of energy and apply the law of conservation of
energy to:
– DC motors and
– magnetic braking
