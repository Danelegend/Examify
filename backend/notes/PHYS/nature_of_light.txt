You are helping with The nature of Light for HSC Physics. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Electromagnetic Spectrum
investigate Maxwell’s contribution to the classical theory of electromagnetism, including:
– unification of electricity and magnetism
– prediction of electromagnetic waves
– prediction of velocity
describe the production and propagation of electromagnetic waves and relate these processes
qualitatively to the predictions made by Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory
conduct investigations of historical and contemporary methods used to determine the speed of
light and its current relationship to the measurement of time and distance
conduct an investigation to examine a variety of spectra produced by discharge tubes, reflected
sunlight or incandescent filaments
investigate how spectroscopy can be used to provide information about:
– the identification of elements
investigate how the spectra of stars can provide information on:
– surface temperature
– rotational and translational velocity
– density
– chemical composition
Light: Wave Model
conduct investigations to analyse qualitatively the diffraction of light 
conduct investigations to analyse quantitatively the interference of light using double slit
apparatus and diffraction gratings $d * \sin{\theta} = m * \lambda$
analyse the experimental evidence that supported the models of light that were proposed by
Newton and Huygens
conduct investigations quantitatively using the relationship of Malus’ Law $I = I_{max} \cos^2{\theta}$ for
plane polarisation of light, to evaluate the significance of polarisation in developing a model for
light
Light: Quantum Model
analyse the experimental evidence gathered about black body radiation, including Wien’s Law
related to Planck's contribution to a changed model of light
 - $\lambda_{max} = b / T$
investigate the evidence from photoelectric effect investigations that demonstrated inconsistency
with the wave model for light
analyse the photoelectric effect $K_{max} = hf - \phi$ as it occurs in metallic elements by applying the
law of conservation of energy and the photon model of light
Light and Special Relativity
analyse and evaluate the evidence confirming or denying Einstein’s two postulates:
– the speed of light in a vacuum is an absolute constant
– all inertial frames of reference are equivalent
investigate the evidence, from Einstein’s thought experiments and subsequent experimental
validation, for time dilation $t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})}}$ and length contraction $l = l_0 * \sqrt{(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})}$ and analyse
quantitatively situations in which these are observed, for example:
– observations of cosmic-origin muons at the Earth’s surface
– atomic clocks (Hafele–Keating experiment)
– evidence from particle accelerators
– evidence from cosmological studies
describe the consequences and applications of relativistic momentum with reference to:
 - $p_v = \frac{m_0 * v}{\sqrt{(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})}}$
 - the limitation on the maximum velocity of a particle imposed by special relativity
Use Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence relationship $E = mc^2$ to calculate the energy released
by processes in which mass is converted to energy, for example:
 – production of energy by the sun
– particle–antiparticle interactions, eg positron–electron annihilation
– combustion of conventional fuel
