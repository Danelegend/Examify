You are helping with the universe to the atom for HSC Physics. Use the following topics to answer a question:

Origins of the Elements
investigate the processes that led to the transformation of radiation into matter that followed the
‘Big Bang’
investigate the evidence that led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe by Hubble
analyse and apply Einstein’s description of the equivalence of energy and mass and relate this to
the nuclear reactions that occur in stars
account for the production of emission and absorption spectra and compare these with a
continuous black body spectrum
investigate the key features of stellar spectra and describe how these are used to classify stars
investigate the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and how it can be used to determine the following
about a star:
– characteristics and evolutionary stage
– surface temperature
– colour
– luminosity
investigate the types of nucleosynthesis reactions involved in Main Sequence and Post-Main
Sequence stars, including but not limited to:
– proton–proton chain
– CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle
Structure of the Atom
investigate, assess and model the experimental evidence supporting the existence and properties
of the electron, including:
– early experiments examining the nature of cathode rays
– Thomson’s charge-to-mass experiment
– Millikan's oil drop experiment
investigate, assess and model the experimental evidence supporting the nuclear model of the
atom, including:
– the Geiger-Marsden experiment
– Rutherford’s atomic model
– Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron
Quantum Mechanical Nature of the Atom
assess the limitations of the Rutherford and Bohr atomic models
investigate the line emission spectra to examine the Balmer series in hydrogen
relate qualitatively and quantitatively the quantised energy levels of the hydrogen
- $E = hf$
- $E = \frac{h*c}{\lambda}$
- $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R [\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_t^2}]$
investigate de Broglie’s matter waves, and the experimental evidence that developed the
following formula:
 - $\lambda = \frac{h}{m*v}$
analyse the contribution of Schrödinger to the current model of the atom
Properties of the Nucleus
analyse the spontaneous decay of unstable nuclei, and the properties of the alpha, beta and
gamma radiation emitted 
examine the model of half-life in radioactive decay and make quantitative predictions about the
activity or amount of a radioactive sample using the following relationships:
 - $N_t = N_0 \exp^{-\lambda * t}$
 - $\lambda = \frac{\ln{2}}{t_{1/2}}$
 where $N_t$ = number of particles at time $t$, $N_0$ = number of particles present at $t = 0$, 
 $\lambda$ = decay constant, $t_{1/2}$ = time for half the radioactive amount to decay
model and explain the process of nuclear fission, including the concepts of controlled and
uncontrolled chain reactions, and account for the release of energy in the process
analyse relationships that represent conservation of mass-energy in spontaneous and artificial
nuclear transmutations, including alpha decay, beta decay, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion
account for the release of energy in the process of nuclear fusion 
predict quantitatively the energy released in nuclear decays or transmutations, including nuclear
fission and nuclear fusion, by applying:
– the law of conservation of energy
– mass defect
– binding energy
– Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence relationship
Deep inside the Atom
analyse the evidence that suggests:
– that protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles
– the existence of subatomic particles other than protons, neutrons and electrons
investigate the Standard Model of matter, including:
– quarks, and the quark composition hadrons
– leptons
– fundamental forces
investigate the operation and role of particle accelerators in obtaining evidence that tests and/or
validates aspects of theories, including the Standard Model of matter
